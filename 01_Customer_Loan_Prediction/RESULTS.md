## Model Performance Summary

Multiple supervised learning models were evaluated, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees (C5.0), Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.

Key findings:
- Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks delivered the strongest predictive performance.
- Naive Bayes provided a strong baseline with minimal tuning.
- Decision Trees offered interpretability but comparatively lower predictive accuracy.

## Key Drivers
Income, average credit card spending, and CD account ownership consistently emerged as strong predictors of loan acceptance.

## Business Implication
Using predictive targeting to prioritize customers with a high likelihood of loan acceptance can significantly improve campaign efficiency and reduce marketing costs.
