## Segmentation Summary

Customer segmentation was performed using both hierarchical clustering (Ward’s method) and k-means clustering on normalized variables.

Key findings:
- A six-cluster solution provided meaningful separation of customer behavior.
- Distinct segments emerged based on flight activity, loyalty engagement, and tenure.
- High-value frequent flyers and low-activity customers were clearly distinguishable.

## Stability Test
After removing 5% of the data and re-running the clustering analysis, cluster profiles remained largely consistent, indicating robust segmentation results.

## Business Implication
Marketing and loyalty strategies should be tailored by segment, with premium offerings for high-engagement customers and activation campaigns for low-activity segments.
