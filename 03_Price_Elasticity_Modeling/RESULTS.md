## Regression and Elasticity Results

Linear regression analysis revealed a negative relationship between price and total sales, confirming expected demand behavior.

Key findings:
- The estimated price coefficient was negative and statistically meaningful.
- Price elasticity estimates indicate that demand for vodka is price-sensitive.
- Advertising variables showed mixed effects across model specifications.

## Business Implication
Aggressive price increases are likely to reduce sales volume. Pricing decisions should be complemented with targeted advertising rather than relying solely on promotional spend.
