## Results Summary

### Price Sensitivity
Linear regression analysis indicates that the estimated price coefficient is negative but very close to zero, implying that demand for SVEDKA vodka is relatively inelastic with respect to price. Changes in price have a limited impact on total sales volume, suggesting that consumers are not highly price-sensitive in this category.

### Advertising Effects
Advertising variables exhibited mixed effects across model specifications. Broadcast-oriented channels such as TV and radio demonstrated meaningful positive impacts on sales, while print- and news-based advertising showed weaker and less consistent effects. This indicates that not all advertising channels contribute equally to demand stimulation.

### Elasticity Interpretation
Price elasticity of demand was computed using the standard point elasticity formulation based on the price-only regression model. The resulting elasticity magnitude confirms that vodka demand is not price-sensitive in the observed range, reinforcing the conclusion that pricing power exists.

## Business Implications
- The relatively inelastic demand suggests that moderate price increases can be implemented to improve margins with minimal risk to sales volume.
- Marketing investments should be prioritized toward high-impact channels such as TV and radio rather than uniformly across all media.
- Pricing and advertising decisions should be coordinated, using promotional activity to support revenue optimization rather than volume preservation alone.
- Elasticity estimates should be periodically re-evaluated as market conditions, competitive behavior, and consumer preferences evolve.
