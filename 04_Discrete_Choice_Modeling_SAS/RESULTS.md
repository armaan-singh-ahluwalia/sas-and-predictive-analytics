## Choice Model Results

Conditional Logit and Mixed Logit models were estimated to analyze consumer product choice behavior.

Key findings:
- Price had a statistically significant negative effect on choice probability.
- Promotional variables such as display and feature increased purchase likelihood.
- Mixed Logit models captured meaningful heterogeneity in consumer preferences.

## Elasticity Analysis
Own- and cross-price elasticity estimates revealed substitution patterns among products, indicating competitive interactions within the category.

## Business Implication
Pricing and promotion strategies should account for consumer heterogeneity and substitution effects rather than applying uniform actions across products.
