## Choice Model Results

Conditional Logit and Mixed Logit models were estimated to analyze consumer product choice behavior across multiple product alternatives.

Key findings:
- Price had a statistically significant negative effect on choice probability, indicating strong price sensitivity in consumer choice decisions.
- Promotional variables such as display and feature significantly increased purchase likelihood.
- Mixed Logit models captured meaningful heterogeneity in consumer preferences across products and attributes.

## Elasticity Analysis
Own- and cross-price elasticity estimates indicate that demand in the yogurt category is highly elastic. Even modest price changes lead to substantial shifts in choice probabilities, with consumers readily substituting between competing products. Cross-price elasticities highlight strong competitive interactions and low switching costs within the category.

## Business Implications
- Given high price sensitivity, aggressive price increases are likely to result in meaningful loss of volume and market share.
- Competitive pricing should remain a central component of strategy, particularly in price-sensitive segments.
- Promotional levers such as displays and features are effective tools for temporarily shifting demand but should be used strategically rather than as substitutes for competitive pricing.
- Pricing and promotional strategies should account for consumer heterogeneity and substitution effects, avoiding uniform pricing actions across all products.
