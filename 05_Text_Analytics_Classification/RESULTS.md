## Classification Results

Text classification models were built using TF-IDF features and evaluated using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

Key findings:
- TF-IDF weighting improved class separability in sparse text data.
- Naive Bayes provided a fast and effective baseline model.
- Support Vector Machines achieved higher predictive performance by capturing complex decision boundaries.

## Business Implication
Automated text classification can support scalable content screening and prioritization. SVM models are preferred when accuracy is critical, while Naive Bayes is suitable for rapid deployment.
