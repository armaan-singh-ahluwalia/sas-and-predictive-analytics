# Projects

# Customer Loan Acceptance Prediction (R)
Binary classification models to support credit decision-making using ANNs, SVMs, Naive Bayes, kNN, and Decision Tree models, balancing predictive accuracy and interpretability.

# Airline Customer Segmentation (R)
Unsupervised clustering to identify distinct customer segments and derive actionable marketing strategies.

# Aggregate Demand Analysis and Price Elasticity Modeling for Vodka Sales using SAS (Consumer Goods)
Regression-based demand modeling to estimate price sensitivity and inform pricing strategy.

# Discrete Choice Modeling Using Mixed and Conditional Logits (SAS) on Yoghurt sales
Econometric analysis of consumer choice behavior using conditional and mixed logit models.

# Text Analytics and Classification (R)
TF-IDF–based document representation with supervised learning models (Naive Bayes and SVM) for automated text classification.
